# Anime Recommendation Engine
I've always disliked the recommendations that Crunchyroll has given me when searching for a new anime show to watch. Either the recommendation is an all time, top rated anime or a newly added show which has no following or reviews. I feel none of the recommendations are personalized. This is why I seek to create my own recommendation engine for anime.
